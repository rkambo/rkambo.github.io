          <h2>Description and Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            I built an application that allowed a user to play a game of
            blackjack in their terminal in the C++ language. This was to give me
            a bit of exposure to the C++ language and I thought that the most
            appropriate output of that would be a game; especially one as
            familiar as blackjack. C++ is a departure from the languages that
            I'm familiar with, as after working primarily with C in university,
            I moved to higher level languages such as Java and Javascript in the
            workplace.

          <h2>Learnings</h2>
          <p>
            Working with C++ was quite a humbling experience. There are plenty
            of things that I took for granted with higher level languages that
            C++ reminded me of from working with C. Mainly, having to use
            pointers and manage memory myself. Even though I had opportunities
            to avoid using pointers, I didn't want the overall experience to
            just be developing something with a different syntax. C++ puts more
            emphasis on being efficient, as programs in the language are built
            for low-latency and high performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a fun experience. Pointers could get challenging at
            times, but I learned to appreciate the amount of control they could
            grant you if understood them. One interesting thing that I learned
            was that enums are often used in the language, but since there's no
            good way to get the number of constants in an enum, a workaround
            that is used in the industry is to create a constant to denote the
            size of the enum.
          </p>
          <p>
            One interesting thing that I learned was that although enums are
            often used in the language, there wasn't a clear way to get the
            number of constants in an enum. I found that a common workaround for
            this problem was to make a constant at the end of your enum which
            would end up holding the value of your size. So, if your enum had 3
            constants and it started from index 0, the num_of_constants would be
            3. This would mean that any time you insert into the enum, the
            num_of_constants would get updated accordingly. I found it so
            interesting that a creative solution like this came in the face of a
            constraint with the language.
