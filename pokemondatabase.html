          <h2>Description and Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            This application allowed a person to search for a pokemon and
            retrieve information related to that pokemon. This works similar to
            an encyclopedia of animals with facts ranging from observations on
            their physiology, behaviour, etc. This was developed using the MERN
            stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS). Information was retrieved
            from the PokeAPI, stored in a Mongo database and would subsequently
            be served to a React Frontend with a NodeJS backend using Express
            middleware. I also utilized the Go programming language to construct
            a service which would periodically poll the PokeAPI for new
            information to maintain data relevancy. The main motivation for
            creating this application was to gain exposure to these
            technologies, but in a enjoyable and approachable way.

          <h2>Learnings</h2>
          <p>
            I haven't worked with React in years, but this was my chance in a
            long time to try to make a deeper dive in it so I could make a front
            end. Learning about React, combined with having to learn the ins and
            outs of using CSS was definitely a challenge. I often struggled with
            what I thought were basic tasks, such as positioning and sizing
            elements. But along the way, I gained a greater appreciation for
            user interface design. Making things look good isn't easy. Things
            that look good in your head don't always look too great when you
            actually make them. However, much like with other projects, the
            community has their own interesting approaches to make things easier
            to digest. For instance, I was encouraged to try using the flexbox
            layout in CSS, and it was supported by a plethora of guides made by
            developers who understood the struggle of trying to understand these
            components.
          </p>
          <p>
            With React in particular, much emphasis was placed on using states
            in a responsible way. This would be the way that React would handle
            the flow of information between components; acting as their memory.
            I found that one of the best ways to keep state managed was actually
            through creating diagrams on paper. It helped to visualize the page,
            break it apart into modular components, and understand how the state
            information would flow between them. It was a learning curve, but it
            was worth it to get to work with a powerful framework that can
            simplify the front end development process.
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose Go to make the polling service due to it's reputation for
            being a smart choice for creating microservices. I wanted to take
            advantage of Go's multithreading capabilities to make bulk data
            upserts into Mongo. Since my data needed to be loaded in batches, I
            decided to use threading for each API call, and ended up managing
            them using waitgroups and mutexes. As a low level language, Go was
            powerful, but had limitations with features that were readily
            available with higher level languages. For example, with JSON data,
            I had to marshal data directly from the responses onto structs in
            order to use the data. What I learned from this is to be cautious
            with what I can afford to take for granted when picking languages,
            as it can add hidden complexity when building applications.
