          <h2>Description and Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            I created an application which allowed users to find cheap flight
            offers. This was set up with a NodeJS backend that called on the
            Amadeus API for flight information, and using Discord as a chatbot
            interface. This came from a curiousity to work with Discords bots,
            as they have a very large presence on Discord for a large variety of
            uses.
          </p>
          <span class="image main"
            ><img src="images/flightbot.gif" alt=""
          /></span>
          <h2>Learnings</h2>
          <p>
            This application was formed at a time where API's were no longer as
            easily accessible to hobbyist developers. Many free tiers for API
            access were removed. Finding travel API's was also very challenging,
            as trusted brands such as Expedia either didn't have readily
            accessible API's or were only making them available through applying
            for partnerships. I was fortunate in finding the Amadeus API to suit
            my use cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with the Discord API could definitely be challenging at
            times. Navigating the documentation was tricky, as it could get very
            dense. Still, getting exposed to Discord bots proved beneficial, as
            it can be a good candidate for a user frontend instead of creating a
            full user interface.
