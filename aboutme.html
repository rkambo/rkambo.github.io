            When I worked as a Backend Intern a few years ago, I remember when a
            friend of mine was stuck on a problem that was plaguing him for a
            couple of hours. I remember taking a look at it and I said "Hey,
            what if you tried this?". His response was, "Wow that's so dumb,
            but..it worked? But it's so dumb!" And so on. We laughed for a
            couple of hours then too. It was moments like these that really
            inspired me to become a better Software Engineer. I learned that it
            wasn't always about applying logic to a problem, but you could
            approach things from a different angle, and sometimes get really
            creative. We're fortunate in the world of development to be able to
            fail quickly and safely; not just so that we can guarantee the right
            answer, but for the opportunity to get really imaginative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even in my current role, it's those developers who laughed the most
            that really inspired me to learn more. I've been taught by seniors
            who aren't afraid to give you those "dumb ideas", but can back them
            up with strong fundamentals and their depth of knowledge. More
            importantly, it taught me that being a true mentor isn't just about
            having that knowledge, but about the responsibility of inspiring
            growth and being a role model to strive for.
